## React- Prisma2 - GraphQL - PostgreSQL

How to run on your local machine:
1. git clone https://github.com/gplaz005/user-login
2. install dependencies with npm install or yarn install
	you may need to npm install inside the server folder as well
	(npm install prisma --save-dev)
3. create a new database on PostgreSQL
4. create a new .env file inside the Prisma folder and inlude the following:
DATABASE_URL = 'postgresql://johndoe:randompassword@localhost:5432/mydb?schema=public'
replace the fields depending on your new PostgreSQL Database.
5. inside your Prisma folder run: npx prisma migrate dev --name init --preview-feature
this will create the migration from your code to the new Database
(if migration folder was already created rename it and run the script again)
6.run pm install @prisma/client



# Run Server and App

open your browser and test the server on http://localhost:4000.
to run app go to root folder and run: npm start.
open your browser and use the app on http://localhost:3000.




# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
